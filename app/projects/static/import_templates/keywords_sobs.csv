Molecular Cell Biology,"Understanding the structure, function, and behaviour of cells, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (including plants) employing techniques like microscopy, molecular and synthetic biology and genetics to explore cellular processes such as cell cycle, photosynthesis, metabolism, and differentiation: providing insights into fundamental biological mechanisms.",Biochemistry
Working with local schools,"Working with a particular school and teacher, you will identify a subject area within which you will develop resources to deliver some part of the curriculum in an engaging and innovative way. You will then evaluate the effectiveness of the resources. ",SOBS
Educational research,"Be involved in an educational research project. This could be evaluating skills development in the curriculum, employability teaching, or another educational research project. As part of this you may design a survey or focus group questions and then analyse the data collected.  ",SOBS
Designing educational resources,"Design, development, and analysis of an educational resource/ tool/ application using a systematic approach. In collaboration with their supervisor, students identify the area of need and using evidence decide upon a suitable output/ product, which may then be rolled out and evaluated.  ",SOBS
Outreach and public engagement,"Design, development, and analysis of an outreach resource/ tool/ application, using a systematic approach. In collaboration with their supervisor, students identify the area which would benefit from additional outreach resources, and using evidence decide upon a suitable output/ product, which may then be rolled out and evaluated. ",SOBS
Practical curriculum development,"By actively engaging in curriculum development, students will help develop new practicals or field resources and evaluate their effectiveness",SOBS
Cancer microenvironment,"Exploring how the environment surrounding cancer cells, including non-cancerous stromal cells such as immune cells and fibroblasts, contribute cancer growth and progression. The aim is to understand the role of the microenvironment to help develop therapies that target both cancer cells and stromal cells.",MCCM
Cancer Cell Signalling,"Proper cell communication breaks down during cancer development due to genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional or post-translational changes. Work here explores how signalling networks are disrupted or modified during cancer and from interventional therapies. Our research covers various levels of cellular processes, for example from membrane receptors, metabolic reprogramming, to chromatin remodelling.",MCCM
Cancer Genetics,"Examining the role of genetic mutations in the contribution towards cancer disease progression as well as therapy response. Using various cutting-edge techniques, we investigate how biomarkers, oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes contribute towards disease.",MCCM
Cancer immunology,"Exploring how cancer cells are impacted by immune interaction. Examining mechanisms of cancer cell immune evasion, immune cell surveillance, the role of the tumour microenvironment, as well as the potentials of immunotherapy.",MCCM
Cancer Medicine ,"Genetic changes to tumour cells make them susceptible to targeted therapies. Working across disciplines (academic researchers, clinicians, and industry connections) work will help to discover these vulnerabilities and identify new therapeutic targets.",MCCM
Cancer Outreach,We engage with the public in the local area to increase awareness of our research (ranging from molecular and cell biology to clinical applications) and raise funds to support this. We use this public engagement opportunity to communicate the importance of early detection of cancer and how that facilitates prognosis.,MCCM
Drug discovery,"Working across our research themes, projects in this area will explore the drug discovery process.  Studies may explore novel drug targets,  repurposing licenced drugs for alternative uses or developing models to investigate disease.",Pharm
Pre-clinical drug development,"Working across our research themes,  projects will focus on drug efficacy, formulation and pharmacokinetics",Pharm
Drug Safety,"Working across our research themes, projects will determine safety and toxicology profiles. Projects may explore the adverse effects of drugs, including injury to specific organs, such as liver, kidney and the GI tract, plus allergic drug reactions. ",Pharm
Clinical drug development,"Working across our research themes, projects may investigate inter-individual differences in the response to medications using a variety of techniques.",Pharm
Systems pharmacology and information science,"Working across our research themes, these projects combine big data, omics analysis, bioinformatics and modelling within a pharmacological context",Pharm
