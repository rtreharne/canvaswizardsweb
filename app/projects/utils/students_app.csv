I thoroughly enjoyed writing my library dissertation on immune checkpoint inhibitor safety, where I explored the importance of correctly identifying and reporting adverse drug reactions, and I would now like to gain practical laboratory experience in this area. While my 3rd-year laboratory project focused on immunopharmacology, I investigated the characterisation of T-cell clones from patients with drug hypersensitivity, linking to drug safety from a different perspective. These projects significantly strengthened my research and laboratory skills, as reflected by the two first-class marks I received.

Dedicating myself to an MBiolSci research project on drug-induced toxicology within the Pharmacology department would enable me to continue working at a high standard while contributing meaningfully to this highly important field of research. I chose not to take the pharmaceutical toxicology module because I intended to focus my research project in this area, while also gaining a broader understanding of how pharmacology can be applied across fields such as cancer and infection biology. This was in the hope of becoming a more well-rounded candidate for future employment.

While I would be happy to undertake any project in Pharmacology, I am particularly eager to further explore drug safety or a closely aligned topic, such as cardiotoxicity or inter-individual differences in drug response.",yes,University of Liverpool,School of Biosciences,2024-09-12 20:13:57.077151+00:00

Asthma research is particularly compelling to me due to ongoing advancements in drug therapies and the potential for innovative treatment solutions.

Additionally, I am equally enthusiastic about cancer and genetics research, which are areas I may pursue through the NHS Scientific Training Programme. Both fields are of great interest to me, and I am eager to contribute to research that can lead to significant advancements in cancer treatment and genetic understanding.

In summary, while I am keenly interested in projects related to clinical drug development for asthma, I am also very open to and excited about opportunities in cancer and genetics research. I believe that engaging in any of these areas will provide a strong foundation for my future career and align with my professional aspirations.",no,University of Liverpool,School of Biosciences,2024-09-03 14:48:46.293232+00:00
